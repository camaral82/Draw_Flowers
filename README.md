Drawing Flowers Using Mathematics - Phyllotaxis

This is a Datacamp's project, where I used ggplot2 package to draw flowers using R comands.

The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called phyllotaxis and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. 
In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.
